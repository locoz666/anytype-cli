# Anytype CLI

A command-line interface for interacting with [Anytype](https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-ts). This CLI embeds [anytype-heart](https://github.com/anyproto/anytype-heart) as the server, making it a complete, self-contained solution for developers to work with a headless Anytype instance.

## Installation

Install the latest release with a single command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyproto/anytype-cli/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run the Anytype server
anytype serve

# Or install as a system service
anytype service install
anytype service start

# Authenticate with your account
anytype auth login

# List your spaces
anytype space list
```

## Usage

```
anytype <command> <subcommand> [flags]

Commands:
  auth        Manage authentication and accounts
  serve       Run anytype in foreground
  service     Manage anytype as a system service
  shell       Start interactive shell mode
  space       Manage spaces
  update      Update to the latest version
  version     Show version information

Examples:
  anytype serve                     # Run in foreground
  anytype service install           # Install as system service
  anytype service start             # Start the service
  anytype auth login                # Log in to your account
  anytype auth create               # Create a new account
  anytype space list                # List all available spaces

Use "anytype <command> --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Running the Server

The CLI embeds anytype-heart as the server that can be run in two ways:

#### 1. Interactive Mode (for development)
```bash
anytype serve
```
This runs the server in the foreground with logs output to stdout, similar to `ollama serve`.

#### 2. System Service (for production)
```bash
# Install as system service
anytype service install

# Start the service
anytype service start

# Check service status
anytype service status

# Stop the service
anytype service stop

# Uninstall the service
anytype service uninstall
```

The service management works across platforms:
- **macOS**: Uses launchd
- **Linux**: Uses systemd/upstart/sysv
- **Windows**: Uses Windows Service

### Authentication

Manage your Anytype account and authentication:

```bash
# Create a new account
anytype auth create

# Log in to your account
anytype auth login

# Check authentication status
anytype auth status

# Log out and clear stored credentials
anytype auth logout
```

### API Keys

Manage API keys for programmatic access:

```bash
# Create a new API key
anytype auth apikey create --name "my-app"

# List all API keys
anytype auth apikey list

# Revoke an API key
anytype auth apikey revoke <key-id>
```

### Space Management

Work with Anytype spaces:

```bash
# List all available spaces
anytype space list

# Join a space
anytype space join <space-id>

# Leave a space
anytype space leave <space-id>
```
